This directory is used to store the concatenated contracts to verify on etherscan.

### Usage

Modify the list of contracts to be joined in `concatenateContracts.sh`.

`npm run concatenate`

Output is in `./concatenated`.

With the current version of etherscan's verifier, you may need to use the "beta" version.
In this version, you can enter the "runs" parameter, which is `0` for our compilations.
